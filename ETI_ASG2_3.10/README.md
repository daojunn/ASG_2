<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I have included all the necessary code in this repository for you to implement the comment and rating microservice into you guy's various different packages.

There are a total of 6 microservices you will need to run:
* Comment Microservice
* Rating Microservice
* Tutor Microservice
* Student Microservice
* Module Microservice
* Class Microservice


## Things to take note
If any of the above microservices is under your package, please do use your own as the last 4 stated above is simply to mock the data and to be able to return those data back to Comment & Rating Microservices for testing purposes.
